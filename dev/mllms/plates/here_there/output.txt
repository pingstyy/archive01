This tutorial book resulted from my lecture notes developed for undergrad 
uate engineering courses in mathematics that I have been teaching over thelast several years at l cole Nationale Sup rieure de l lectronique et de ses
Applications  ENSEA  Cergy in Val d Oise department  France 
My main inspiration to write this tutorial type collection of solved prob 
lems came from my students who would often ask   How do I solve this  It isimpossible to  nd the solution  while struggling to logically connect all thelittle steps and techniques that are required to combine before reaching thesolution  In the traditional classical school system  mathematics used to bethought with the help of systematically organized volumes of problems thathelp us develop  the way of thinking  in other words  to learn how to applythe abstract mathematical concepts to everyday engineering problems  The
same is true for music  it is also true for mathematics that in order to reach
high level of competence  one must put daily effort in studying typical formsover a long period of time 
In this tutorial book  I choose to give not only the complete solutions to
the given problems but also guided hints to techniques being used currently Therefore  problems presented in this book do not provide review of therigorous mathematical theory  instead the theoretical background is assumed while this set of classic problems provides a playground to play and to adoptsome of the main problem solving techniques 
The intended audience of this book are primarily undergraduate students
in science and engineering  At the same time  my hope is that students ofmathematics at any level will  nd this book a useful source of practicalproblems for practice

viiAcknowledgements
I would like to acknowledge all those classic wonderful collections of
mathematical problems that I grew up with and used as the source of myknowledge  and to say thank you to their authors for providing me with
thousands of problems to work on  Speci cally  I would like to acknowledge
classic collections written in ex Yugoslavian  Russian  English and Frenchlanguages  some are listed in the bibliography  Hence  I do want to acknowl edge their contributions  which are clearly visible throughout this book andare now being passed on to my readers 
I would like to thank all of my former and current students who I had
opportunity to tutor in mathematics since my student years  Their relentlessstream of questions posed with unconstrained curiosity forced me to open mymind  to broaden my horizons and to improve my own understandings 
I want to acknowledge Mr  Allen Sobot for reviewing and verifying some
of the problems  for very useful discussions and suggestions  as well as hiswork on technical redaction of this book 
My sincere gratitude goes to my publisher and editors for their support
and making this book possible

Exercise 1 2  page 5
1 Absolute numbers are de ned as  x x   x  0 or x  x   x   0  that is to say that
result of the absolute operation is always a positive real number   It is important to realize that
an equation with one absolute expression is actually a compact syntax to write two equations Consequently  the presence of multiple absolute expressions inside a single equation means thatwe must systematically write separate equations for each combination of positive negative cases 
Oneabs function generates two equations  thus two solutions
 x 3 7
x 3 0
 x 3 x 3 x 3 7 x1 10
x 3 0 x 3 x 3 x 3 7 x2 4
Therefore  there are two discrete solutions  x1 10 and x2 4  see Fig  1 1 
Fig  1 1 Example 1 2 1 a

However  an inequality with abs function generates two inequalities  thus two intervals as
the solutions  First  we calculate the interval boundaries

Due to two abs functions  in total there are four possible inequalities to solve
 x 5 4
where  the four possible inequalities are found as

1 The factor theorem states that a polynomial P x  has a binomial factor  x n if and only if
P n 0  that is to say nis one of the P x  roots  Otherwise  if the value P n negationslash 0 we say that
r P n  is the reminder of division P x x n 
Given divisor  x 1 i   e  n 1  we  nd
r P 1 1 4 2 1 3 3 1 2 4 1 1 1
Therefore n 1 is not the root of P x   a Solutions 21
Given divisor  x 1 i   e  n 1  we  nd

r P n  is the reminder of division P x x n 
Given binomial  x 1  the condition of divisibility for P x x  1 is that r P 1 0 
therefore we write

Given Q x   x2 4x x x 4  we calculate the division reminders for both  x 0

Given

we calculate the division reminders for both  x 1 and x 2 factors  There are multiple xto

r 2 P 2 2 2021 2 2 2020 1 22021 22021 1 1
Because r 1 negationslash r 2 and there are only two points in consideration  x 1a n d x 2 
we conclude that reminder must be a  rst order polynomial r x ax b  where its linear
coef cients are calculated as

1 The relations between the sum and product of polynomial roots  attributed to Fran ois Vi te  are
rather practical  among other applications in mathematics  for rapid factorization of quadraticpolynomials 
Given x
2 6x 5 we search for factors x1 x2of  5  so that x1 x2  6  Being
prime number   ve is divisible only with  1 5  We  nd that  1a n d  5 factors satisfy both
conditions  i e  their product equals  5 and their sum is  6  Thus we write 
x2 6x 5 x2 1 x 5x 5 x x 1 5 x 1 x 1 x 5 a 
Two factors of    14  whose sum equals  9a r e 2a n d 7  thus we write 
x2 9x 14 x2 2x 7x 14 x x 2 7 x 2 x 2 x 7 b 
Two factors of    8  whose sum equals  6a r e  2a n d  4  thus we write

Therefore  the quadratic equation is solved as
 x 3 2 16 x 3 4 x1 2 3 4 x1 1 x 2 7 a 
The leading coef cient  i e   2  is not equal to one so it can be factored  In addition  the
linear term coef cient  5  is a prime number  consequently it is not possible to factor  2  that is
necessary for the complete square form  The workaround is to multiply and divide  5  by two b Solutions 29

1 After rearranging all terms given polynomials in descending powers  the long division is done in
the manner similar to division of large numbers 
Given two polynomials  we proceed as follows 
1  Divide only the two highest power terms  underlined  and write the result  that is to say x4 
x x3 
 x4 2x3 7x2 8x 12 x 3 x3
2  Multiply x3with the divisor polynomial and write the product under dividend
 x4 2x3 7x2 8x 12 x 3 x3
x4 3x3 Multiply
3  Subtract the vertically aligned terms  i e   x4 2x2 x4 3x2 x3  then add the next term
from dividend  i e   7x2  Now  the problem is reduced to division  x3 7x2 x 3 
 x4 2x3 7x2 8x 12 x 3 x3
 x4 3x3 
 0 x3 7x2 a Solutions 31
4 Next term in the solution polynomial is found as x3 x x2  then repeat the previous steps
until the last term in the solution is found as
 x4 2x3 7x2 8x 12 x 3 x3 x2 4x 4
 x4 3x3 
x3 7x2
 x3 3x2 
 4x2 8x
 4x2 12x 
 4x 12
 4x 12 
 0
Because the last subtraction equals zero means that r 0  that is to say x 3 is zero of
P x x4 2x3 7x2 8x 12  It is veri ed by setting x 3i nP x  as

2 One of the techniques to factorize odd order polynomials exploits two fundamental theorems in
algebra  very loosely interpreted as 
1  The total number of polynomial roots  i e  both real and complex  is equal to the polynomial
degree  where the complex roots come in pairs  i e  each complex root is accompanied by itscomplex conjugate pair  Consequently  in odd order polynomials there must be at least one realroot  i e  the one that does not have its pair 
2  After multiplying the leading and zero term coef cients  polynomial roots may be found
among the factors of that product Solutions 33
Given P x x3 x2 4x 4  the leading coef cient is    1  and the zero power term
equals    4  Factors of  4 1  4a r e 1 4 2  Thus we calculate P x  for each
x 1 4 2a s
P 1 1 3 1 2 4 1 4 0 x1 1
P 1 1 3 1 2 4 1 4 6 P 1 negationslash 0
P 2 2 3 2 2 4 2 4 0 x2 2
P 2 2 3 2 2 4 2 4 0 x3 2
P 4 4 3 4 2 4 4 4 36 P 4 negationslash 0
P 4 4 3 4 2 4 4 4 60 P 4 negationslash 0
Therefore 
P x x3 x2 4x 4 x x1 x x2 x x3 x 1 x 2 x 2 
As it happens  all three roots are real a 
Similarly  given Q x x3 1  factors of its zero power term are  1  We calculate 
Q 1 1 3 1 2 Q 1 negationslash 0
Q 1 1 3 1 0 x1 1
That is to say 
Q x x 1 ax2 bx c 
 
 ax2 bx c Q x x x1 x3 x 1

 x3 1 x 1 x2 x 1
 x3 x2

Important polynomial form is known as the difference of two cubes  G i v e n P x x3 y3
by inspection we conclude that one root of this binomial is x y i   e  P y 0  Therefore  P x 
is divisible by  x y  we note that Example 2 10 b is special case when y 1  Using long

Important polynomial form is known as the sum of two cubes  G i v e n P x x3 y3by

1 Partial fraction form of a rational function is very useful for calculating its integral  A general case
of rational expression of two polynomials  for example  k th order Pk x andm th order Qm x 
where m k   may be written as
Pk x 
Qm x P x 
 x x1 x x2 x x3 n ax2 bx c 
 
x x1 
x x2 1
 x x3 1 2
 x x3 2 n
 x x3 n x 
 ax2 bx c 
where      are the coef cient constants to be calculated  and partial decomposition
rational forms are created as follows 
1  For each unique zero of Q x   s u c ha s x1 x2  there is one rational term 
2  For zeros with nmultiplicity  such as x3  there is a series of nrational terms 
3  When quadratic term  ax2 bx c has complex zeros  then its corresponding numerator
must be linear binomial 
In this example  Q x  has two unique zeros at x 1a n dx 4  thus we write
P x 
Q x x
 x 1 x 4 A
x 1 B
x 4 A x 4 B x 1 
 x 1 x 4 
 Ax 4A Bx B
 x 1 x 4 A B x B 4A
 x 1 x 4 
Therefore  by equalizing numerators P x  before and after decomposition  we calculate the
unknown constants as a 38 2 Polynomials

In this example  Q x  has one unique zero at x 2 and one double zero x 0  thus we

because  product of negative and positive terms is always negative  Here  we have a negative

the following series of transformations

however  only x 1 satis es both conditions a Solutions 57
The second case leads into the following solutions

Thus  x1 1  double root  and x2 2

3 Inequalities compare two functions within one or multiple intervals 
The idea is to compare powers of the same base  i e

22 parenrightbig 1 x 2x 2 2 2 x
Due to the same base  this inequality is equivalent to
x 2 2
x x 2 2
x 0
There is discontinuity at x 0 for the inverse function  thus we examine two intervals 
1 x  0 Obviously  within interval x 0  the inequality is always satis ed because
all terms on the left side are positive  Therefore  one solution is interval x  0 
2 x  0 Within interval x       0  terms including xare obviously negative  however 
there is one term that is positive  i e     2  We  nd that
x 2 2
x 0 x2 2x 2 0 x1 2 R
in other words  there is no change of sign  In conclusion  for x       0 x 2 2 x 0 
Therefore  the inequality is not satis ed for x  0 a Solutions 59

Double inequality with the absolute expression  x2 x is decomposed in intervals x2 x 
0  and x2 x 0  In this speci c example  however  the equality points are not included  the
problem has  strict  inequalities 
1 x2 x  0 Within this interval  x x 1 0  that is to say  either x  0a n dx 1 0
 not possible  or x  0a n d x 1 0 which is possible if x 0 1 strict inequality 
 Hint  AB   0 means that AandBmust have opposite signs 
2 x2 x  0 Within this interval  x x 1 0  that is to say  either x  0a n dx 1 0
thusx  0 o rx  0a n dx 1 0 thus x  1  H i n t   AB   0 means that AandBmust
have same signs 
Given these intervals  inequalities are solved after converting it into the form with same base  i e 
1 3 x2 x 9 30 3 x2 x 32 0 x2 x and x2 x 2
Which leads into x2 x 2 0 resulting in x 1a n d x  2 interval  Putting everything
together  we conclude that x    1 2 where  x negationslash 1 0 2 b 60 4 Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

1 In examples  a to c note the relationship between the numbers of zeros in 10  100 1 000 and
the respective equation solutions  In this special case of logarithmic functions with the base 10 anddecade numbers  the noted shortcut helps us to perform mental calculations of these logarithms

In addition  writing  log  without speci c index number assumes the base 10  while writing  ln 
assumes the base e  For example  x log 1 000 000 is found by counting the zeros  therefore

Exercise 5 1  page 68
1 Two  gures are said to be similar if one  gure can be derived from the other by operations
of uniformly scaling  translation  rotation and or re ection  For example  starting with triangle
OMN in Fig  5 2  triangle OPQ is derived after multiplying each side of OMN by factor of
two  similarly any other triangle can be derived by using factor n  for example triangle OKL  
By inspection of Fig  5 2it is evident that except for the scaling factors the form of all three
triangles did not change  thus  they are similar   By using Pythagoras s theorem it is not dif cult
to verify that all three triangles are indeed right angled whose corresponding sides are simplyproportional to each other

We take a look at angles as well  Obviously  each triangle has one of its angles equal to 90 I n
addition  the corresponding sides of  in each triangle are proportional  thus  is shared by all
three triangles  Consequently  knowing two angles in a triangle the third angle  is calculated so
that their sum adds to 90 180  In conclusion  direct consequence of similarity is that
not only the  gure sides are proportional  including the factor n 1  but also their corresponding
angles are equal   The similarity of right angled triangles is among most important and exploited
properties in mathematics Solutions 73
2 By inspection of Fig  5 2we write ratios among triangle sides 
There are three basic ratios 
1  The cathetus forming  i e  adjacent  and hypotenuse  the side opposite the right angle 
are related as
ON
OM OQ
OP OL
OK 3
5 63
 105 n 3
 n 5 const  
2  The cathetus opposite to  and hypotenuse are related as
MN
OM PQ
OP KL
OK 4
5 84
 105 n 4
 n 5 const  
3  The catheti opposite and adjacent to  are related as
MN
ON PQ
OQ KL
OL 4
3 84
 63 n 4
 n 3 const  
The fact that these three ratios are constant for all corresponding similar triangles is very useful
because  given a right angled triangle  by knowing the side ratios we can calculate variousunknown sides and angles Thus  relative to  we name these three ratios as
adjacent
hypotenuse cos opposite
hypotenuse sin opposite
adjacent tan 
Similarly  the equivalent ratios exist relative to  
adjacent
hypotenuse cos opposite
hypotenuse sin opposite
adjacent tan 
We search these ratios related to  et when triangles are rotated  scaled  translated and or
re ected by looking for  adjacent  and  opposite  sides relative to the angle under consideration In addition  it is useful to notice that by knowing sin xand cos x  the third ratio  i e  tan xis also
known because

Angles between 0 and 90 are said to be  in the  rst quadrant  of the unit circle  They are
reused to calculate trigonometric functions of angles in other three quadrants by rotating theirrespective right angled triangles into the  rst quadrant 
Case  x 0
 In this special case  right angled triangle whose hypothenuse equals one degener 
ates into a horizontal line segment  as a consequence the hypotenuse is found  on top  of adjacentside  thus the two are equal  At the same time  the opposite side of the triangle is reduced to zero By de nitions we write
cos 0
 adjacent
 hypotenuse 1 
sin 0 0
hypotenuse 0 
tan 0 sin 0 
cos 0 0

Case  x 30 6We calculate trigonometric functions with the help of triangle in Fig  5 3 
Here  hypotenuse is two times longer than a one of the cathetus  thus the two associated anglesmust be in the same proportion  We conclude the following

Case  x 90 In this special case  right angled triangle whose hypothenuse equals one degener 
ates into a vertical line segment  as a consequence the hypotenuse is found  on top  of oppositeside  thus the two are equal  At the same time  the adjacent side of the triangle is reduced to zero By de nitions we write

Trigonometric functions of sin and cos are commonly summarized in a graph known as  unit
circle  see Fig  5 5  The circle radius  i e hypotenuse  is normalized to one  Consequently  the
length of adjacent side becomes numerically equal cos  and the length of opposite side becomes
numerically equal to sin   because

In the  rst quadrant we  nd angles 0 30 45 60  and 90 s e eF i g   5 5  Relative to the  rst
quadrant  angles in the second quadrant are shifted by 90  thus we  nd angles 
30 90 120 
45 90 135 
60 90 150 
90 90 180 
Angles in the third quadrant are shifted again by another 90  thus we  nd angles

45 180 225 
60 180 240

the associated right angled triangle for each angle and deduce its corresponding values of sin x

For example  an angle  90 in the second quadrant and its corresponding  angle in
the  rst quadrant create similar right angled triangles  see Fig  5 6  By de nitions we read its
sin value as the segment length at the vertical axis  and its cos  value as the segment length at
the horizontal axis  After comparing side lengths of similar triangles in second and  rst quadrant marked in solid red lines  while accounting for the positive negative signs  we  nd the followingidentities

Main idea in this kind of problems is that powers and roots of a complex number are much easier
to  nd if we convert its algebraic into exponential form Thus   rst we calculate module of a temporary variable  t and argument  of the 4th root s
argument t  then we write its exponential form as follows

The original equation   6 8  is 4th order polynomial  therefore there must be  in total  four values
ofzthat are valid solutions  Obviously    6 9  is only the  rst of the four values  All solutions of a
complex equations are found on circle whose radius equals to z 
Arguments of the solutions are symmetrically distributed within 2   That is to say  for example 
in the case of second order equation  the two solutions are separated by 2  2 angle  In the
case of third order equation  the three solutions are separated by 2  3 angle  Therefore  the four
solutions of fourth order equation are separated by 2  4 2 and are found as

Solutions
Exercise 7 1  page 131
1 Geometrical interpretation of space is based on de nition of point   which is assumed to have
size of zero  A loose visual interoperation would be a sphere whose radius equals zero  Fig  7 2 
Appropriately  assuming nothing else exists  a point would represent  0 order space  annotated
asR0 
1 Line  Multiple points aligned next to each other  albeit  the distance between any two points
being zero  form line  Therefore  it takes in nitely points to create a line of any length L I f
nothing else exists  line represents one dimensional space  annotated as R1  As an analogy  a
little ant walking along very long wire can move only along forward reverse direction of the
wire  thus it has only one freedom of movement  Assuming one arbitrary point as the reference
for measuring relative distances  it takes only one number to describe distance from any otherpoint to the reference  In addition  sign     shows which side of the reference is measured 
forward  i e      or reverse  i e     
2 Surface  Multiple lines put next to each other create surface   annotated as R
2  Analogy would
be a sheet of paper whose thickness equals zero  In this case the little ant walking on the surfacehas two freedoms of movement  left right and forward reverse  Assuming one arbitrary pointas the reference for measuring relative distances  it takes two numbers to describe positionof any other point on the surface  This pair of numbers is referred to as  coordinates  by
convention coordinates are written as  x  y  pair  where each number represents distance from
the  origin  in one of two directions  In analogy  assuming lower left corner of a page to be thereference point  we can describe position of each letter on the page by measuring horizontaland vertical distances 
3 Volume  Multiple surfaces put on top of each other create volume   annotated as R
3  Analogy
would be a book  where the stacked pages form the third dimension  In this R3space position
of any point is described by three numbers    x y z    each measuring distance from the origin
in the three possible directions  In this space a bee has freedom to  y  that is to say to move inup down direction  Our physical universe is R
3space  and our perceptions are limited to 3D
space dimensions  In mathematics  however  there is no limit on order of space 
An important observation is that each lower order space can be seen as one of possible projections
of the higher order space  That is to say  looked from  straight ahead  a line looks like a point Looked from  a side  a surface looks like a line  Looked from one direction  a cube  3D  lookslike a square  2D  or a sphere  3D  looks like a circle  2D  Mathematically  this reduction isspace is found when one or more equations in a system is not independent  i e  they may be
written as the product of a simple factor and another equation  In linear algebra  a matrix may be
seen a compact form of writing a system of equations  where the zero value of its determinant138 7 Linear Algebra
indicates that one or more equations is dependent  thus the real order of space is lower than the
number of equations in system

2 A vector signi es a variable that has twoproperties  magnitude and direction  That is to say 
a simple number is not vector because it has only magnitude but not direction  For example speed  is not vector because it shows only the time rate at which an object is moving along the
path  A car can be speeding 100
km hdown the highway in both directions  On the other hand 
 velocity  shows both the rate of change and direction of an object s movement Three commonly used vector representations are as follows  In physics   vector  takes geomet rical interpretation in form of a  directed arrow  that indicates both magnitude  i e  the arrowlength  and direction  i e  from its tail to the head  In mathematics  assuming 3D space a vectorvariable is annotated in algebraic form as
 a ax i ay j az k
where  ax ay az are vector magnitudes as measured along the three directions  i j k 
respectively  also referred to as the  unity vectors 
In informatics  the preferred way of representing a vector is in one column matrix form  as forexample
 a

where the column list contains coordinates of each direction relative to origin  0 0 0 i nt h i s
case 3D space  Of course  this matrix version is abstract and the list can be associated with any
physical or nonphysical variable 
3 As de ned  the three unity vectors are used to de ne 3D space and are written in a form of 3  3
matrix as
 i j k 
 100
010
001 
 
where the  rst column is for i  the second column is for j  and the third column is for kunity
vector  Fig  7 3  This resulting matrix where all elements along the main diagonal equal one andSolutions 139
all other matrix elements equal zero is known as  unity matrix  with properties similar to number
one

The matrix form assumes that all vectors originate at  0 0 point  Geometrically  that means
vectors are translated so that their origin is at  0 0 point  when their  nal position is as for      RQ

Exercise 7 3  page 132
1 Vector addition is done by a simple chaining head of one vector to tail of the next one  Vector
representing the total sum starts at tail of the  rst and ends at the head of last vector in the chain 
All vectors in 1D space are collinear  i e  parallel  therefore their direction is already known 
As a consequence  knowing only their magnitude is suf cient  In most general sense  numbers areviewed as the special case of vectors  As illustrated in Fig  7 19  left  sum of two numbers equals
to sum of their magnitudes after accounting for their sign 
2 3 5a n d2  3 1 a Solutions 155
in 2D space not all vectors are collinear  which is to say that in general case  the sum of two
vectors is not simply equal to the sum of their magnitudes  Instead  we must apply the rules oftriangles  see Fig  7 19  right  In order to illustrate the practicality of matrix noti cation  we note
that modules of vector projections add in the same manner as  regular  numbers  Formally  giventhat

1 In its basic form  a function is equivalent to a machine that for any given number input xperforms
an operation f  x  and produces the corresponding output y  Similarly  for any given vector input
 vlinear operation L v performs an operation and produces the corresponding vector output w 
as illustrated in Fig  7 21

Another way to visualize operation of a linear transformation is to imagine that the input vector
is displaced in space until it overlaps the output vector  see Fig  7 22

However  linear operation L v displaces allvectors in R2vector space  that is to say it displaces
all the points on the surface   For example  after linear transformation L v displaces basis vector i 1 0 into the new vector L i 1 3  while at the same time basis vector j 0 1 is
displaced into the new vector L j 2 1 relative to the initial position  see Fig  7 23 S i n c e
all points on the surface are also simultaneously displaced  we can imagine that the surface is elastic  and it  stretched  In this analogy  now L i andL j represent basis vectors in the
transformed space In summary  for a transformation to be linear it must obey the following rules 
1  after the transformation all grid lines must stay straight 
2  all the grid lines must stay parallel and equidistant because the distance between them must
always be one basis vector 
3  the origin point must not move 
Due to these rules  the numerical form of a vector as written relative to the basis vectors  i j 
before  and  L i   L  j   after the transformation stays the same

2 For example  we can create a graph as in Fig  7 24 s ot h a t vis transformed into L v  We note
the relationship between the original and transformed greed lines  In order to better visualizespace transformation  the original grid is kept in the background  In addition  by following thetransformation of basis vectors  
 i j we can visualize how the original R2space is rotated 
 ipped  and stretched into the new basis vectors L i    L  j 
By inspection of grid in transformed space  we write the expression for transformed L v within
new coordinating system based on basis vectors L i    L  j  and we compare it with the original
vector vas
L v 2L i L j   7 3 
and
 v 2 i j  7 4 
In order to be truly linear transformation  the numerical forms of   7 3 a n d  7 4  are same 
Consequently  coordinates of new basis vectors are  by de nition  L i 1 0 andL j 
 0 1 158 7 Linear Algebra

Exercise 7 6  page 134
1 In order to keep track of matrix transformations  the three equations are numbered as  1   2   3 
and their coef cients are placed in  rst  second  and third matrix row  In consequence  the verticalcolumns are where the coef cients of x y z variables are placed  In addition  the solutions of each
equation are placed in the fourth column of expanded matrix 
 x   y   z 
5x 5y 15z 40 1 
4x 2y 6z 19 2 
3x 6y 17z 41 3 
The objective of this technique is to transform the expanded matrix into its equivalent diagonal 
ized form  i e  all coef cient found at diagonal equal  1  while at the same time all the othercoef cients equal to  0

We start by transforming coef cient found at  rst row rst column position into  1  In order to
do so  obviously  it must be divided by  ve  Which is to say that all coef cients in the  rst row arealso divided by  ve  Then systematically transform the other coef cients at and below diagonal In order to annotate transformations  for example  the operation of division of each term in the
 rst row equation  1  by  ve is written as    1 5  Of course  there are multiple ways to
transform the matrix that do not in uence the  nal solution  it is matter of practice and preferencewhich particular intermediate steps are taken  However  good strategy is to transform the diagonaland lower triangle coef cients  rst  Then  transform the upper triangle coef cients

a b c 5 2

We start by taking advantage of the fact that the  rst coef cient of  2  already equals one  thus
we exchange positions of  1  and  2  In any case  the initial order of equations is arbitrary

In geometric interpretation  we follow the basis vectors  Columns of matrix hold the coordinates
of transformed basis vectors as measured in the original space 
For example  in  a we look at matrix as linear transformation of vector  3 0  The vector
coordinates stay numerically same in both original and transformed spaces  see Fig  7 33 N o t e
that the product solution  3 6 gives coordinates of vas measured in the original space  In order
to create graphs for  b to d we take the same approach

2 Geometrically  matrix matrix product can be interpreted as  linear transformation of linear
transformation  Thus  we can reason it out in two steps 
First matrix on the left side of product holds coordinates of the original basis vectors  i j 
whose magnitudes equal one

Result of this  rst transformation are transformed basis vectors whose coordinates  in the
original space  are  1 2 and 1 1 s e eF i g   7 34  narrow line arrows  Second matrix
contains coordinates of these two new basis vectors  as measured in the transformed space  see

repeated multiplication  This is because the powers of a diagonal matrix are simple to calculate

Exercise 8 1  page 188
1 There are various possibilities that determine whether the limiting value exists or not 
A continuous function is de ned in all points  including for x 2  and therefore calculating
any limiting value is trivial  For example 
lim
x 2f  x lim
x 2x 2
because both left side  i e  lim x 2  and right side  i e  lim x 2  limits point to the same value of
function  i e  f 2 2  Fig  8 1 
Fig  8 1 Example 8 1 1 a 
0202limx 2 f x 
limx 2 f x 
xf x a 
A non continuous function may or may not have de ned limit  For example  function f  x 
isnotde ned for x 2  When calculating limits  we  nd
lim
x 2 f  x 1
lim
x 2 f  x 3
For the reason that the left side and right side limits are not equal  consequently  limit lim x 2f  x 
does not exist  Fig  8 2 b 190 8 Limits
Fig  8 2 Example 8 1 1 b

limx 2 f x

Similarly  function
f  x x 2 
x 2
is not de ned for x 2  it equals 0  0  Consequently  the  rst limitation is x negationslash 2  We analyse
separately left and right sides of x 2 point  Fig  8 3

 x 2 x 2

lim

Therefore  for the reason that the left and right side limits are not equal  the conclusion is
that lim x 2f  x  does not exist

For a special case of rational function  Fig  8 4  after excluding division by zero  i e  x negationslash 0 
we calculate the limit as
lim
x 0f  x x2 2x
x
 lim
x 0 x x 2 
 x
 2 d 
which is equal from both sides of x 0  In conclusion  even though x negationslash 0  the limit exists in that
point because both left and right side limits are equal  search for  Two Policemen and a Drunk or  Sandwich  theorem

Similar example of rational function where x negationslash 5 also permits the existence of limit as
lim
x  5f  x lim

x  5x2 3x 5x 15

 lim
x  5 x 3 x 5 
 x 3 x 5 x negationslash 5 
 5 3
 5 3 4
In conclusion  even though the function is not de ned for x 5  Fig  8 5  limit lim x  5f  x 
4  This case is also known as  pole zero cancellation  because both numerator and denominatorhave one equal root  i e  x 5  that is cancelled  and therefore value of the function for x 5
is neither zero nor in nity  We note that is not the case for x 3 where the limit does not exist
because
lim
x  3 f  x    and lim
x  3 f  x   
that is to say  they are not equal  and thus the limit does not exist

Vertical asymptotes are found as roots of Q x 0 
Q x 0 x2 4 0 x1 2 x 2 2
Third order polynomial must have at least one real root  thus  real zeros of f  x  are found as
roots of P x 0
P x 0 x3 xxx 0 x1 2 3 0
That is to say  all three roots of P x  are real and identical  i e   triple zero  The zeros and
poles of f  x  are not equal  and thus there are no pole zero cancellations  These two vertical

Note that L H pital s rule is applicable only in the case of rational functions that take the form of
lim
x x0f  x 
g x f  x 0 
g x 0 0
0or 
 
Then  the rational function s limit may be calculated after taking derivates of its numerator and
denominator separately  that is to say
if lim
x x0f  x 
g x 0
0or 
 lim

Given f  x 1 1 x  therefore the argument mapping is
 x 1 x x 1 1 x 1 x x 1  That is to say  if argument x 1i s
replaced with the argument x  then on the right side of the equation each occurrence of xmust be
replaced with x 1  i e

the root of ln  1 0 function  see Fig  10 8  Equally  if the function s argument is an expression 
again it has to equal one  Therefore  we write x 2 1  that is x 3 and simply translate
horizontally the ln xgraph  see Fig  10 8  Adding a constant affects the yvalue after we account
for the function s argument  That is to say  causes the vertical shift of ln  x 2 s e eF i g   10 8

Domain of de nition D  there is one double pole of f  x  calculated as

if f  x f x odd

Function s sign  There is one triple zero of f  x  found when
f  x 0 P x 0 x3 0 x1 2 3 0

example

A function may change its sign  i e  positivity negativity  at zero and break points  which divide
real domain Dinto the following intervals
x   0  0  0 1   1

 x 1 2       
f  x    0    
In conclusion  f  x  is negative for x  0  changes its sign at x 0  and it is positive for x  0 c Solutions 229

A third order polynomial must have at least one real zero  By factor theorem we search the  rst
solution among the factors of the x0term  here it is  1  We  nd that f prime prime 1 1 3 3 1 0 
therefore f prime prime x is divisible by x 1  i e x1 1  Consequently

Given condition that x 1  we  nd that

Slope m1of tangent T1inx 1 is calculated as
f prime 1 2 12 2 1 
 12 1 2 1 m1 1
Therefore  equation of tangent is T1 m1x b1 x b1  where constant b1is found from the
condition that T1crosses point A 1 2 T h a ti st os a y
x 1 T1 2 2 1 b1 b1 1 T1 x 1
We show this tangent in Fig  10 11

Given line y xwe know that its slope is m2  1  therefore all parallel lines have the
same slope  As a consequence
T2 x b2
Now  the problem is to  nd at what xthe slope  i e  the  rst derivative  of f  x  equals f prime x 
m2 1  We write
f prime x 2 x2 2x 1 
 x2 1 2 1
 
 2 x2 2x 1 x4 2x2 1 x4 4x 3 0
By exploiting the factor theorem  and factors of number 3  we  nd that
P x x4 4x 3 P 1 1 4 4 1 3 0
Therefore  P x  is divisible by x 1 binomial and we factorize P x  by divisions
 x4 4x 3 x 1 x3 x2 x 3
We repeat again the factor theorem to  nd
Q x x3 x2 x 3 Q 1 1 3 1 2 1 3 0
 
 x3 x2 x 3 x 1 x2 2x 3
Therefore  after noting that this quadratic polynomial does not heave real zeros  we write  x4 
4x 3 x 1 2 x2 2x 3  Now we solve the fourth order equation as
 x 1 2 x2 2x 3 0 x1 2 1
 
f prime 1 0a n d f 1 0
We conclude the coordinates of B 1 0 because Bpoint must be at f  x  curve where the
 rst derivative equals zero Therefore  equation of T
2is derived as
T2 x b2 1 0x b2 b2 1 T2 x 1
General condition for two lines to be orthogonal is that their slopes have relationship m1 
 1 m2  which is exactly the case with T1andT2 i e  1  1 1  Therefore they are normal
to each other  as illustrated in Fig  10 12  b Solutions 237

where  in general case  there is no closed form analytical solution  We must use  for example

Piecewise linear functions are among most often used approximations in engineering  Given
their graphical representation  it is necessary to derive analytical forms for each of the linear
sections separately  The main idea is that the operation of  integration  itself is fundamentallyan operation of addition  Also  a linear function is the easiest function to integrate  Therefore knowing a priori the analytical form of each linear piece  the overall integral is reduced to thesum of simple integrals of linear functions 
A linear section y ax bis determined by two points in the plane  that is to say that knowing
coordinates  x  y  of these two points on the line two constants  a  b  are determined with a
simple algebra Here we derive three linear sections  as emphasized by different colors in graph and points

Geometrical interpretation is that integral Iequals the total area underneath quadratic function
f  x 2that consists of three distinct regions  These three quadratic sub functions and their
respective areas are shown by colored sections in Fig  11 5 
Alternative Solution Due to symmetry of given f  x 2  areaI1in Fig  11 5 is identical to areas of
the other three segments  i e   0 25 0 5 0 5 0 75 a n d 0 75 1 0  Thus  it is suf cient to solve
only the  rst integral within  0 0 0 25 interval and keep in mind that it accounts for one quarter

respect  obviously  hypotenuse is a linear function whose algebraic form is found by knowing thatthe line must cross two points whose coordinates are  0 0 and 2 1  We write two equations as

Calculation of volumes is done by  integral of an integral  or multiple integral  in other
words  one integration for each variable  Visually  a surface is created by adding in nitely manylines in parallel next to each other  where the respective length of each line equals f  x   i e   rst
dimension  and the lines are added within the given range  i e  second dimension 
For example  the lowest horizontal surface  see Fig  11 17   is created by aligning y directional
lines   f  x    within range of x 0 4  where each line has the length equal to three  In other

3 4 12  Visually  this surface is equivalent to one page of a book whose volume we want to
calculate  That is to say  we add pages on top of each other in z direction  Thickness of surface is
in nitely small  that is to say it is equal to dz  We have to simply  pile them up  between zero and

5 One possible geometric interpretation of  average  may be by comparing  signed  area under the
function with the area of a rectangle in the same interval  Surface area under function is calculatedwith the  nite integral  Surface area of rectangle Aequals its length a equal to the interval 
multiplied by its height h  Therefore  the height of the rectangle is calculated by dividing its area
by its length  If the two surface areas happen to be equal  then the height hof the rectangle is
called the  average  of the function 
For example  see Fig  11 18  left  by inspection we  nd the area under piecewise linear function
f  x  inx 0 4 interval to be equal to 0  2 0 2 4 units  At the same time  rectangular
surface in Fig  11 18  right  in x 0 4 interval is A a h 4 1 4  Thus  in this special

Mathematical software that blindly implements the Newton Leibniz formula reports this result 
However  the inverse function is odd  that is to say the origin symetric  Fig  11 25   One should

Important to Know
Multivariable functions are in the form f x y z   
Limits 
limx x0 
y y0 
z z0 
 f x y z 
exists if all variable limits converge to the same value  otherwise  the limit does not exist  In its basic
form  for example  the following limits converge to the same value  note  the limit is calculated along
one variable at the time  while all the others are kept constant 
limx x0 
y0 
z0 
 f x y z   a
limx0 
y y0 
z 
 f x y z   a
limx0 
y0 
z z0 
 f x y z   a
 
Note that this condition is necessary but not suf cient to prove the existence of the global limit 
Partial Derivatives  these are calculated for each variable relative to all the others  For example  in the
case of a two variable function f x y    we can use the following equivalent syntax form notations to
speci cally write the order of second partial derivatives as

Exercise 12 2   page 285
1 In the  rst iteration  limits of a multivariable function are calculated along each variable  in the
given examples along  x  y    However  in order to be de ned  i e  the surface is continuous in any
direction  alllimits along any arbitrary directions must be equal 
lim
 x y 1 2 x2y3 x3y2 3x 2y 1223 1322 3 1 2 2 11  a 
lim
 x y 0 0 x2 y2
x2 y2 0 0
0 0  does not exist
We can con rm this conclusion by the two limits along x axis and y axis as
lim
 x y x 0 x2 02
x2 02 x2
 x2 1
lim
 x y 0 y 02 y2
02 y2 y2
 y2 1
These two limits are not equal  and thus we conclude that in this case lim  x y x 0 f x y  does
not exist b Solutions 289
However  even if the two limits along x a n d y axes are equal  it is necessary but not
suf cient condition  For example 
lim
 x y x 0 xy
x2 y2 x 0 
x2 0 0
lim
 x y 0 y xy
x2 y2 0 y
0 y2 0
however  limit along y xis
lim
 x y x x xy
x2 y2 xx
x2 x2 x2
2 x2 1
2
therefore  even though the  rst the two limits are equal  they are different from the third  and thus
the limit does not exist c 
This limit appears to not exist  because
lim
 x y 0 0 3x2y
x2 y2 parenleftbigg0
0 parenrightbigg
however  lim
 x y x 0 3x2y
x2 y2 0

lim
 x y 0 y 3x2y
x2 y2 0
y2 0
lim
 x y x x 3x 3
2 x2  lim
 x y 0 0 3x
2 0
Even though the three limits are equal  the question is how to prove that this limit exists along any
arbitrary line  We can use  the squeeze theorem   sometimes known as  the two police of cersand burglar  or  the sandwich theorem  The idea is to determine two extreme boundaries of agiven function and then to bring these two boundaries together  the function itself must alwaysstay in between the two extremes  In the given analogy  if a burglar is squeezed between twoof cers  and if the two of cers are walking towards prison building  the burglar is forced to endup in the prison 
Since we are looking for lim
 x y 0 0 f  x    we express the distance between the origin point
 0 0 and any point of f  x  as

where the last absolute value expression is valid because number  3  x2 a n dy2are always
positive  and thus they are equal to their respective absolute values  Consequently  the lower sidelimit of   12 1  is zero d 290 12 Multivariable Functions
Accordingly  because x2 x2 y2is always true  the upper side limit is
x2 x2 y2 x2
x2 y2 1

x2
x2 y23 y 3 y 
In conclusion  two extremes of   12 1  are on the lower side it is limited by  0  and on the upper
side by 3  y t h a ti st os a y

Now  the left and right side inequalities in   12 2  are heading towards the origin  i e   x  y   
 0 0  then  by the virtue of its position between the two extremes  the distance is  squeezed 
between two limits and must also converge to zero  Fig  12 6 
In summary  the limit exists in any direction as

It is important to note that  as long as the form of analytical function z x  is same where the
only change is the value of x0  then all respective graphs have the same shapes  That is to say 
the graphs are only shifted to x x0  This property greatly simpli es the analysis of more
complicated z x  functions  General idea is to factorize complicated z x  functions into these
basic simpler  building blocks  and then  assemble  the  nal response by adding these basicfunctions

Obviously  this example is a second order function whose poles are real  and thus it is possible to
decompose it into the basic  rst order functions  Each summation term in the logarithmic form is
in effect one of the already studied basic forms  as annotated 
Similarly  the phase plot is created as the sum of the corresponding linear terms

Once the gain and phase logarithmic forms are factorized   rst we plot each of the summing terms
1 2 and 3 separately  see Fig  13 11 left  Then  the summing operation is done by simply adding
the linear sections of all three terms to produce the Body plots for gain and phase  see Fig  13 11

The legend has it that this classic problem of the sum of an arithmetic sequence was solved by
Gauss when he was still in the elementary school  His proof is based on understanding that the
addition is a commutative operation  meaning that order does not matter  thus the same sumcan be written in both ascending and descending orders  then term by term addition of the twoequations gives b Solutions 335

Derivation of sum   15 1  is based on the mathematical induction technique  The main idea is split
into two steps  First we prove that equality is valid for a certain number  often for n 0o rn 1
 but  any number n Ncould be used as the starting point  In the second step  we make the
claim that ifthe equality is valid for a given n kcase  then it must be also valid for the next
term  i e  n k 1 
Speci cally 
1 Case  n 1we must show that the following equality is correct 
S1 1 summationdisplay

Indeed  the last formula gives

where the form of   15 1  is identical to   15 2  after each nis replaced by n 1  which is by

1 Product of a function x t  and t t0 equals to zero  except on the point where  t is located 
i e t t0  That is to say  while solving the de nite integral  in effect we  search  the location
of t function  Consequently  only at that point function x t0 keeps its value  in any other case
 t x t   0 t negationslash t0  Therefore  we write as follows 
Given 
 integraldisplay 
 sin 2 3 t     t  1 d t
we search the location of  t 1  By de nition  it is found at the position when its argument
equals zero  i e  when t 1 0 t 1  Consequently  the product sin  2 3 t t  1 is not
equal to zero only for t 1  Thus  we write

This integration is illustrated in Fig  16 13   which shows the position of  t 1 function relative
to sin 2 3 t   The multiplication operation is done before the integration and  obviously  only
one point i e  sin  2 3 is not multiplied by zero  This example illustrates the idea of  sampling 
 or  saving  certain points of a given function by using Dirac function

We can deduce derivative u prime t by observing graphical interpretation  Fig  16 15  
While keeping in mind that derivative of a constant equals to zero  and that in general case itshows the function s rapidity of change over given interval  we conclude that if the interval equalsto zero  the change must be in nite  due to division by zero  By de nition  that in nite changein amplitude over zero interval describes Dirac function

Sign t function can be derived from u t  by simple transformations as illustrated in
Fig 16 16  
In the  rst step u t  is multiplied by factor two  which doubles its amplitude for t  0  At this
stage we note that sign  t function has the same form  but appears shifted down by step of one

Relation between  t  and t  is illustrated in Fig  16 17   There are two rapid changes at the
edges of  t  that generate Dirac functions at t T 2a n dt T 2 moments  We note that the
leading edge of  t  jumps from zero to one  thus the derivative is positive  However  the trailing
edge jumps from one to zero  thus its associated derivative is negative  In summary

1 In order to carry on the required transformations  visually  it helps to pick some of the
typical points in the given function  for example x 1  x 0  x 2  and follow their respective
movements 
A function is delayed or advanced when a constant is added to the initial argument  for
example if
x 0 x t 2 
where    2  is the shifting constant  New coordinate positions are found by equalizing the two
arguments  e g 
0 t 2 t 2
Similarly  we  nd transformed positions of the other typical points  and conclude that this
transformation shifts the original function in the positive direction by two steps  Fig  17 9 a Solutions 361

here  the origin point does not move  It is evident that when the function s argument is multiplied
by a constant greater that one  visually  the overall effect is  compression  of the original form

2 When multiple transformations are required  there are multiple ways to execute them 
Method 1 
Transformation y t x 2t 3 consists of one compression  i e  2 t  and one delay  i e   3  If
the delay is applied before the compression  we  nd
x t delay x t 3 compression   x 2t 3 
In the  rst step  the delay x t 3  we write
x 0 t 3 0 t 3
which is shown in Fig  17 13

Example 17 1 2 a

In the second transformation  the compression  we keep the delay and while the time is
compressed i e  x 2t so that we write
x 0 2t 0 t 0
x 1 2t 1 t 1 2
x 3 2t 3 t 3 2

Alternatively  the two transformations in y t x 2t 3 m a yb ee x e c u t e ds ot h a tt h e
compression is applied before the delay  thus we  nd

That is to say  application of compression x 2t results in the function form as in Fig  17 15

Second transformation  the delay of  t 3 2 shifts the function horizontally  resulting in the
same result as in Fig  17 14  b 
3 By focusing  for example  to point x 0 we then compare when the new argument also equals zero 
Given x t  function  one way to derive the total transformation may be to apply delay x t 4 
 rst  followed by time inversion x t along with the compression factor of 0  5t

two functions by using graphical method  In sequence of transformations  we convert u t

After the  rst step  Fig  17 28 a  b  the change of variable tinto temporarily integration
variable  does not change the initial form of neither x t  nory t  functions  thus only y 
function is illustrated a 
In the second step  in order to create y  function y  is simply mirrored around the
vertical axis  Fig  17 28 c  Note that the origin  0 point is still known  and the form of y t 
visually stays unchanged b 
In the third step  y is shifted to an arbitrary position t  thus y t in Fig  17 28 d
shows only the positions of rising  found at  3 t  and falling  found at  1 t  edges relative
to  Consequently  depending upon relative position of tin reference to the origin point  0

We keep in mind this bidirectional relationship between Dirac function x t  and its Fourier
transformation of the constant function X   F i g   19 5  That is to say  the two functions are said
to be  dual  because Fourier transform of Dirac function is a constant function  as well as theopposite  i e  Fourier transform of a constant function is Dirac function  Physical interpretation
is that in order to synthesize Dirac function it is necessary to add all possible sin   t  whose
frequencies are in the range

Fourier transformation of a constant function may be derived  for example  by using  reverse
engineering  technique  i e  by using the inverse Fourier transformation integral  Given thatx t a

F 1 X   x t def 1
2 integraldisplay

2 integraldisplay 
 X ej td 
The idea is to gradually deduce the form of X  until the inverse Fourier equality satis ed  i e 
the right side of the equation is reduced to a0and becomes equal to the left side  To start with 
X  must include a 2  term  so that it cancels the already existing 2  term  as
a0def 1
HH2 integraldisplay

Then  there must be the a0constant on the right side somewhere  thus we further deduce that

In order for the last equality to be valid  the right side integral must be reduced to one 
One possible solution would be that the exponential term equals to one  As already seen inExample 19 1 1 a  we can use the sampling property of Dirac function because

Which is to say that Fourier transformation of a constant function is indeed Dirac function  the

that is  Fourier transformation of delayed Dirac function  t is also the constant function 
where the complex exponent term only adds to phase delay  that does not change the form of
the constant functions We note that this property of Fourier transform is general for any delayed function  i e  Fourier ofa delayed function equals to Fourier transformation of its non delayed version multiplied by thephase delayed term

to a  att 0 generates negative  2a  Delta function  In Example 19 1 1 a  and b the
duality between delayed Delta and constant functions is derived  thus in combination with theFourier transformations of function derivatives we  nd

6 Sign function sign  t does not converge when t    thus direct application of Fourier integral
also produces non converging result  One possible method to derive Fourier transformation is to
express sign  t in terms of u t  and then to use limit of exponential function 
Speci cally  we write
sign t u t u t 
In addition  we can interpret the number one as the limit of exponential function when a 0  i e

Second  and much faster  method to derive this Fourier transform function is based on the same

The question is  how to do summation of the last sum  First  modules of all terms equal to one 
Second  each term in the sum is a complex number that is shifted along the circle at the multiplesof 8  that is to say all sixteen terms are uniformly distributed on the unity circle in the complex
plain  see Fig  20 4  We note that  for example  x 6 andx 14 are at the opposite sides  therefore 
their sum equals zero  Formally  we can con rm that statement as e 444 20 Discrete Fourier Transformation

This Fourier transformation result is referred to as  bilateral  as illustrated in Fig  20 6  top 
There are two impulses in  X k  however  we know that sinusoidal function is dual with only
impulse In order to show amplitude  X k relative to the units of frequency  i e   Hz  we must calculate
resolution of each  bin  as

folding
In this case  because Nand sampling frequency fsare numerically equal it happens that kmaps
directly into Hz  That is to say  by selecting different either Norfswe can arbitrary set the res 
olution of Fourier transformation  In addition  impulses found above half of sampling frequency known as Nyquist frequency  are folded over in  unilateral  view of Fourier transformation  as
commonly shown by spectrum analyzers or simulated graphs  see Fig  20 6  bottom 
Consequently  in unilateral view amplitudes at each frequency are calculated as the sum ofsamples already in place and the ones  folded over For example amplitude of sample at x 1H z is increased by amplitude of x 7H z that after
folding over falls on top  thus  H 1H z    4 4 8  This amplitude is the consequence of
N 8  thus in order to show correct amplitude  i e   x t  1  the unilateral graph must be
recalibrated by dividing the amplitudes by N s e eF i g   20 7 452 20 Discrete Fourier Transformation

This series is superimposed to f  t s e eF i g   20 12   which illustrates the approximation  For
 perfect  approximation  there should be an in nite number of terms  The largest discrepancybetween the continuous function f  t  and its approximation is at the end of given interval  Over
wider interval Fourier series is a periodic function

where  k 0 1 2 
In order to simplify the long equations writing  often we use exp  to denote the necessary
exponential term in the above de nition  As n k N changes  we  nd that the number of necessary
calculations increases as follows 
N 1F0 x 0 exp one calculation 
N 2F0 x 0 exp x 1 exp two calculations 
F1 x 0 exp x 1 exp two calculations 
 total  four calculations 
N 3F0 x 0 exp x 1 exp x 2 exp three calculations 
F1 x 0 exp x 1 exp x 2 exp three calculations 
F2 x 0 exp x 1 exp x 2 exp three calculations 
 total  nine calculations 
 
N  total  N2calculations Solutions 459
That is to say  for example  the resolution of 1 Hz within 20 kHz bandwidth means that it is
necessary to do N 20 000 points in the transformation  Knowing that DFT calculation does

The advantage of FFT over DFT increases as Nbecomes larger 
2 The main idea of FFT is to split the grand sum into two separate sums  in the  rst iteration to one
with odd and one with even coef cients  In the subsequent iteration  again every second term isgrouped as  odd  and the other half as  even  group  see Fig  20 13   The process is repeated until
each group consists of two terms only  This process is highly symmetric  as a consequence thebinary form of aligned term indexes in the  nal iteration is binary inverted relative to the binaryform of aligned term indexes at the beginning

As a consequence  it is suf cient to carry out only N 2 calculations  However  each of the

This calculation process is illustrated by  butter y diagram  Fig  20 14   The solutions Xkon the

added to x1w0

the formation of X1equation  This basic butter y diagram is reused for any N 2 Fast Fourier
