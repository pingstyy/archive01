New Concept introduced - (PGI) Programmable Gradient Infromation
(GELAN) Generalized Efficient Layer Aggretion Network
(ELAN) Efficient Layer Aggretion Network
1. (GELAN)
<br/>
<details>
<summary> **GELAN** </summary>
<br/>
  >  It simultaneously takes into account the number of parameters like <br/> 
    - Computational Complexity
    - Accuracy
    - Inference Speed
</details>

PGI is introduced to address the loss of information during data transmission through the "Network Layer" in ~Deep Networks~.
<br/>It allows complete preservation  of input information necessary to calculate the objective function   , for reliable gradient  information weight updates.
<br/>
(GELAN) is based on gradient path planning - was designed to maximize parameter efficiency & surpass existing methods in terms of parameter utilization ,even using only convolution operators.
